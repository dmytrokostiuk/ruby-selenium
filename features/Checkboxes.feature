  Feature: Checkboxes
    The problem

    Checkboxes are an often used element in web applications.
    How do you work with them in your Selenium tests?
    Intuitively you may reach for a method that has the word 'checked' in it - like .checked?
    or .isChecked. But this doesn't exist in Selenium. So how do you do it?

    A Solution

    There are two ways to approach this -
    by seeing if an element has a checked attribute (performing an attribute lookup),
    or by asking an element if it has been selected.

  # this scenario is exercising second approach
  Scenario: select options from dropdown
    Given I navigate to "checkboxes" page
    Then I check if 2nd box is selected
